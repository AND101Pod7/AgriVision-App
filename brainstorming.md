### 5 category evaluation of our top 3 ideas

#### **Idea #7** ####
*    **Mobile:** This product is uniquely mobile because of the location aspect which makes more sense to be through a mobile app. 
*    **Story:** We want a new aspiring gardener to be able to easily take control of their diet from their backyard or balcony garden. Our families, friends, and especially ourselves would definitely get a lot of use from a product like this.
*    **Market:** The intended audience for this app is meant to be anyone interested in starting a food garden. The focus of this app is gardening that anyone can start in their home, which means the market is specific but not too narrow.
*    **Habit**: The aim of this app is not be to addicting like social media but rather for convenience and quick access to gardening information and record keeping purposes.
*    **Scope:** The scope for this app is still being developed but it has definitely been narrowed down a lot since the conception of our idea and it will continue to be narrowed down. However, we want to keep the main objective which is easily accessible gardening info for beginners.

#### **Idea #2** ####
   *    **Mobile:** How uniquely mobile is the product experience? What makes your app more than a glorified website?
*    **Story:** How compelling is the story around this app once completed? How clear is the value of this app to your audience? How well would your friends or peers respond to this product idea?
*    **Market:** How large or unique is the market for this app? What's the size and scale of your potential user base? Does this app provide huge value to a niche group of people? Do you have a well-defined audience of people for this app?
*    **Habit**: How habit-forming or addictive is this app? How frequently would an average user open and use this app?Does an average user just consume your app, or do they use it to create something?
*    **Scope:** How well-formed is the scope for this app? How technically challenging will it be to complete this app by the deadline? Is a stripped-down version of this app still interesting to build? How clearly defined is the product you want to build?
