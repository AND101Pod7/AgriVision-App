### 5 category evaluation of our top 3 ideas
### 

#### **Idea #7** ####
*    **Mobile:** This product is uniquely mobile because of the location aspect which makes more sense to be through a mobile app. 
*    **Story:** We want a new aspiring gardener to be able to easily take control of their diet from their backyard or balcony garden. Our families, friends, and especially ourselves would definitely get a lot of use from a product like this.
*    **Market:** The intended audience for this app is meant to be anyone interested in starting a food garden. The focus of this app is gardening that anyone can start in their home, which means the market is specific but not too narrow.
*    **Habit**: The aim of this app is not be to addicting like social media but rather for convenience and quick access to gardening information and record keeping purposes.
*    **Scope:** The scope for this app is still being developed but it has definitely been narrowed down a lot since the conception of our idea and it will continue to be narrowed down. However, we want to keep the main objective which is easily accessible gardening info for beginners.

#### **Idea #2** ####
*    **Mobile:** This app is uniquely mobile because it encourages you to be away from a computer where you would use a website. 
*    **Story:** The story is compelling because everyone can relate to not knowing what food options they have around them. 
*    **Market:** The market for the app would be large. There isn't a niche that the app targets. Our friends and peers would be able to enjoy the application. 
*    **Habit**: This app is not habit forming because it is something you do only once in a while. 
*    **Scope:** Completing the application in the time alotted may be possible however, the finding an API that prodvides the information we need may be difficult. 

#### **Idea #1** ####
*    **Mobile:** This app is unique and goes further than some applications that only scan labels on food items and give the items nutrional information. Our application would be unique as it tells you were to find a food item. The scanning of the food is also uniquely mobile. 
*    **Story:** The story is not the most compelling as it may be more difficult to use our app to find where to find a food rather that to use a search engine to find places to find the food.
*    **Market:** The market for this application is large because it has to do with food. This would mean the app could be used by everyone. 
*    **Habit**: This app can be habit forming if you are constantly looking for where to find the food in front of you or in images. However, the app would not promote any habit forming behaviors. 
*    **Scope:** This app may be out of the scope of the project. The use of the API to find the options nearby might be okay to implement in a timely matter however, the use of the camera with the application is not something we have covered in the course and may be too complex to complete.
